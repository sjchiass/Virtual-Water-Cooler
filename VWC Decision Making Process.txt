Decision Making Process for Virtual Water Cooler

Match People Who Said Yes to Only Within Field
  - Select everyone who said Yes
    # Can we find a match within people who said yes?
    - Group them by field
	  - For each group
		- If the groups' length > 1
		  - Check the first person's (in the list) language preference
	        - If English
	          - Find everyone who speaks English or No preference; return this group
	        - Else if French
	          - Find everyone who speaks French or No preference; return this group
	        - Else (No preference)
	          - pass (Do nothing - keep the same group)

		  - From the language preference group
		  - Check their time preference
			- If Morning
			  - Find everyone who said Morning or No preference
			- Else if Afternoon
			  - Find everyone who said Afternoon or No preference
			- Else (No preference)
			  - pass (Do nothing - keep the same group)
				
		  - From the time preference group
		  - Randomize the group (shuffle)
		    - If groups' length % 2 == 0 (even)
			  - Make pairs
			  - Add them to the list of matches
			  - Remove them from the list of people who said yes
			  - Update (remove the pair(s) from) the data (frame)
			- Else (odd)
			  - Make pairs with everyone but the last person (this means they can still be matched with people who said No)
			  - Add them to the list of matches
			  - Remove them from the list of people who said yes
			  - Update (remove the pair(s) from) the data (frame)
		- Else (there is only 1 person in these groups within people who said yes)
		  - pass (Do nothing - keep the same group)
	
  # Match people who said Yes and still haven't been matched yet
